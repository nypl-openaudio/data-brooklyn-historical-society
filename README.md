## The Collection Description
[Brooklyn Historical Society](http://brooklynhistory.org/)’s [oral history collections](http://brooklynhistory.org/library/wp/library-collections/oralhistory/) began in 1973 with the Puerto Rican Oral History Collection, 1973-1975 and include interviews with narrators born as early as 1890. [Brooklyn Historical Society](http://www.brooklynhistory.org/) connects the past to the present and makes the vibrant history of Brooklyn tangible, relevant, and meaningful for today's diverse communities, and for generations to come.
